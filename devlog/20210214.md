Still working on the game's rewrite. Successfully generalized a bunch of things that needed generalizing, more specifically with the addition of a State class
and state objects as well as a general nodemap construct that lets me build overmaps and skill trees from the same codebase.

Now it's mostly a matter of porting over most of the rest of the game with small changes, except for the parts dealing with the player's and enemy's stats, which I want
to change to a simpler system. Essentially all upgrades that touch on any player stat should happen in percentages, like +50% or -20% increase/decrease for that stat.
Removing any flat additions or additions of other types to stats will make everything a lot easier to handle and also make it more consistent.
