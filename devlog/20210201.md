Part 1 of the tree is done functionally. Next thing I need to do is add more passives to the pools and to the game itself. Because this inner part
of the tree focuses on the 4 stats rather than the more more general modifiers that I've already added this also gives me an excuse to add extra stat-focused passives, like
"increased attack speed based on health missing" or "gain a buff of 100% increased damage for 2 cycles every 6 cycles" and stuff like that.
