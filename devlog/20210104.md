Good amount of progress today. I feel fairly confident in this project right now because I didn't get demotivated so far and the only next part where I could is when implementing enemies and the
difficulty curve. If I make it past that then the chances that this will make to release are pretty high. I also have a fairly concrete idea of what I want the game to be in terms of progression and
that probably makes it easier to not get demotivated when that part comes.

Either way, a bunch of these passives are fairly intricate to get working properly with all the combinations possible but I managed to do it.
Tomorrow I'll probably focus on adding a mix of passives from different classes (pathing, status, construct) and then once I have about 40 (24 right now) I'll stop and start adding
the easier, dumb passives that are only stat upgrades. That should get me to about 60-70 which is a good number to have for a demo.
