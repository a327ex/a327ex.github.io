* Arena
  * ~~Outlier~~

Made one mini boss out of three for the arena. It has 4 different attacks types all of which can be made harder with variable tweaks on harder difficulties.
I think I coded it wrong though because I think it should choose between each of the 4 attacks randomly but right now it just does them in sequence. Should come back to this later and code
next mini bosses with this in mind.
