* ~~Enemy spawn logic for time win condition~~
  * ~~Every 2 seconds~~
    * ~~Check how many enemies alive~~
    * ~~If less or equal to 0 OR hasn't spawned enemies for 8 seconds~~
      * ~~Spawn enemy batch~~
  * ~~Spawn enemy batch~~
    * ~~Pick one or multiple random spawn positions out of 5 (corners + center)~~
    * ~~Spawn enemies in one of the following patterns~~
      * ~~4 enemies~~
      * ~~4 enemies, delay, 4 enemies~~
      * ~~4 enemies, delay, 4 enemies, delay, 4 enemies~~
      * ~~4 enemies in two different spawn positions at the same time~~
      * ~~4 enemies in three different spawn positions at the same time~~
      * ~~2 enemies in all~~
* ~~Secondary attack~~
* ~~Special attack~~

Spawn logic for time win condition done on a basic level and with Seeker enemies only. 
As I add more enemies I'll have to constantly keep changing this code to accommodate for other enemy variations. 
But for the most part it's fine and solid. Also added logic for secondary and special attacks.

Tomorrow I should add some more basic UI elements to the battle screen and get started on adding passives. 
The strategy that seems to work best is to add one passive 100% completely, which forces me to add at least one basic passive selection screen and to figure out how they're going to be laid out UI wise.
