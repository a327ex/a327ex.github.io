Spent the entire day reworking the site again inspired by [this site](https://lunchbag.ca/) that I previously mentioned.
Now everythings automated and running from a [single build file](https://github.com/a327ex/a327ex.github.io/blob/master/build.moon) that's fairly easy to understand and to change.
I also managed to get e-mail subscriptions working via [mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) and it also seems to work properly.

Features missing: dark mode, tags, and CSS/JS for more involved blog posts (code highlighting, tables, math formulas, etc).
I'll add those as necessary as I port and rewrite most of the posts from the github blog.
Now I'm *finally* happy with how the site works and hopefully I won't feel the need to dramatically change it again.
