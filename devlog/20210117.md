* ~~Arena~~
  * ~~Outlier~~
  * ~~Sleeper~~

Improved the way the Outlier mini boss works and added a second mini boss. Overall I think both of these represent two extremes in terms of effort for mini bosses,
where the Outlier one is the more high effort one, with 6 different attacks, different movement patterns, and so on. While the Sleeper one has a single movement pattern
and very simple attacks that trigger based on percentage of health left.

Before the demo is done I should add another Arena mini boss that's in between these two in terms of complexity but for now I'll focus on the Item and Shop rooms. After
adding those and then adding wave + kill win conditions for normal rooms I should be able to play the game from Lv.0 to Lv.5 and start getting a real sense for how it should
be balanced.
