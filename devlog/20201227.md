* ~~HP UI~~
* ~~Attack UI~~

Not a lot done today, just UI for HP and Attack. There's a consistent pattern arising in the code with all the `hit_flash` variables, 
springs and how they're used to communicate action both in game and with all the UI elements. 
At some point in the near future or after the game is done I should remember to abstract these into an object or to move them up to the GameObject class.

Tomorrow I should focus on doing a few passives to completion (gameplay, UI, icons, distribution, etc) so that I get started on the passive distribution modal that should appear after a room is done. 
It would probably be useful to reuse elements of that model in other rooms, like the shop, item room, etc. 
Slay the Spire does this because everything is a card but I should also be able to get away with something similar.
