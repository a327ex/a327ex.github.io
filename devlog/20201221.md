This was a very good amount of progress for today. Everything needed to make combat work is working well, even with some fancy interactions that add a lot of possibilities in terms of passives. 
Before I start attacking passives I think it's wiser to make the gameplay loop work, 
so tomorrow I'll probably try to tackle enemy spawn logic and then the conditions needed to make sure that the player can win the current room and move on to the next.
