Finished this batch of passives finally. Tomorrow I'll probably work on JUGGLRX a bit and also try to come up with another batch of 50 or so passives that are a bit more creative and aren't just stat conditionals.
Ideally they should play off the initial batch of 50 in some manner. For instance:

* Volleyed Barrages - All your barrage projectiles are shot straight rather than at random angles
* Impact - enemies produce corpses on death which deal damage to other enemies
* Iron Reflexes - take double damage from projectiles, take 1/4th damage from melee hits
* Shockwave - every 4 cycles, push all nearby enemies away from you

Impact, Shockwave and Iron Reflexes play off the Knockback and Pull passives, adding the ability of using them in a more productive manner. Iron Reflexes especifically opens up the possibility for the player to have
a build where he's just moving around the screen physically hitting enemies with his body and making enemies hit each other in chains for most of his damage dealing. Basically the next batch should be full of stuff like this,
stuff that adds flavor to the game and enables a way higher variety of builds.
