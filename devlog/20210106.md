Didn't do any progress today because I was watching the election protests but I had a [nice discussion on Twitter with someone](https://twitter.com/c4p_c5p/status/1346831944919764992) and writing more
about it will probably be useful to solidify my thoughts. As a side note, one of usefulness of having these devlogs is to also have a place where I can write my thoughts in a less organized and quicker
fashion and then with a lot of editing turn those thoughts into more polished blog posts. This is the process I generally have for writing most of what I write on my blog anyway, it's just that now I can do
it closer to when I think about something instead of waiting for the ideas to bubble up enough until writing about it becomes inevitable.

In any case, the initial point that started this whole discussion was a video by Matthewmatosis where he talks about a lot of things:

But two things that caught my attention were clicker games and The Witness. Essentially, he talks about how clicker games, progression systems and grindy games in general are Bad because they're exploitative,
manipulative, etc, all that same nonsense everyone repeats all the time. And then he talks about The Witness and one conclusion he reaches is that people play highly artistic, intellectual games like The
Witness for a fairly meaningless and lowbrow reason, which is to exercise their brains.

My argument is that this difference between both types of games matches pretty closely to what I described in my [borders vs. no borders](https://a327ex.substack.com/p/borders-vs-no-borders) post as
low cognitive load vs. high cognitive load. Games where you have to do the same thing over and over for no good reason, so grindy games essentially, are low cognitive load games. They can be games that
you mindlessly play as you watch/listen to something on your second monitor. Games where you have to be more actively engaged with the game and paying attention, are high cognitive load games.

The general conflict between these two types of games is that people can gravitate more towards one type of game or another (even though most people don't really have a strong preference for either),
and if that preference is particularly strong they will absolutely hate the other type of game and wish it didn't exist. Most game developers tend to be these types of people who have more extreme
preferences, and they to fall on the high cognitive load end of the spectrum. This leads them to perceive low cognitive load games as crude, uninteresting, boring, etc, but also **morally wrong**.

The reason this jump to morality makes sense is primarily because game developers feel very strongly about their distaste for low cognitive load games, and not because there's actually any moral issue going
on. For instance, Matthew makes a point is his video that essentially games like The Witness are mental masturbation for the high cognitively minded person. Is that morally wrong? Because the argument there
is literally the same as the argument against low cognitive load games, which is that those games are serving their audience with their most primal desires, and thus manipulating them. But if your most
primal desire is engaging with things intellectually, then isn't the game developer of The Witness also manipulating his audience? Obviously most of these developers wouldn't agree with this, but the
logic is flawless in my eyes.

So as `c4p_c5p` posted at me today that my ramblings also mapped to jobs in real life I was ecstatic, because this also maps fairly well to a bunch of political issues and dynamics having to do with
intellectual elites, and I outlined that argument in the series of tweets above. 

But another interesting thing that this Twitter user also told me was that he thought this divide between people wasn't entirely along the lines of high vs. low cognitive load, but along the lines of
who values gameplay first. So, to take The Witness as an example, it's very much a game that values gaming as a medium a lot and puts gameplay first.
Blow himself is someone very much like this and he is definitely interested in the things that the medium of gaming can do that others can't.

This is a point that seems correct to me. A lot of the intellectual elite does indeed focus on story and other things that don't really matter to gaming, instead of focusing on gameplay issues.
And the divide in this sense definitely feels exactly the same as the other divides I was mentioning (i.e. all journalists agree that games shouldn't be too difficult, that walking sims are a good thing, that
political games are good except if they have politics the journalists disagree with, and so on). 

I believe this particular divide occurs because these people, primarily journalists, but also a fair chunk of game developers, are people seeking status. They are nobles trying to self-actualize, as I
mentioned in those tweets, and you don't gain status by making a good game, you gain status by making a good movie or writing a good story, which are mediums that are respected by the intellectual elite,
unlike gaming. So all those efforts by developers and journalists alike to make games into art, for instance, are essentially efforts to credentialize games in the eyes of the intellectual elite so that
their jobs can be respected and they can be true nobles, instead of the nobility that's working on a fairly lowbrow and intellectually dirty field full of toys for children like games.

Both of these issues: high vs. low cognitive load, and status seeking by developers and journalists, probably explain most of these differences in ways people perceive these issues. And to defend
Jonathan Blow and his game, this means that while The Witness is a fairly high cognitive load game, because it's a game primarily interested in gameplay, it's not very aligned with the intellectual
elite/nobility around gaming, and thus is treated as such. Which explains it being used as a fairly negative example in Matthew's video, but also explains the distaste a lot of people seem to have
for Blow as a person in the game development community (at least on Twitter, which is the nobility's meeting centre).

On the other hand you can have fairly low cognitive load games that are in fact not at all interested in gameplay, and you know there are many many examples like those, maybe clicker games fall into this.
The point being, my initial idea that high cognitive load = bad and low cognitive load = good wasn't entirely correct, because there's another important variable which could be called... gameplayness.

So you can imagine that this is a matrix, high vs. low in one axis, gameplay first vs. gameplay not first in another. So you have 4 possibilities (there are lots of examples for each category, the ones
given are not exhaustive): high gameplay first = games like The Witness; high not gameplay first = AAA story games like The Last of Us or any of those Kojima games; 
low gameplay first = grindy RPG games like Path of Exile; low gameplay not first = clicker games and grindy games that just have fewer redeeming qualities.

What the **morally wrong** crowd is probably referring to when they say these games are manipulative are probably the low cognitive load, no gameplay quadrant. What I was defending with my tweets was the
entirety of the low cognitive load side, but I wasn't appreciating that the no gameplay quadrant also existed to the extent that it did, which explains why the few people I talked to about this didn't seem
to agree with me that much on my division of the issue.

In any case, this quadrant thing has given me a lot of clarity on this issue and I'll probably turn this into a blog post in the future. It feels like there's a lot to explore on each quadrant
and how people react to games in them.
