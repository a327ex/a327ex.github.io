  * ~~Enemy Progression~~
    * ~~Lv.0 Seeker (10%C, 100%)~~
    * ~~Lv.1 Seeker (15%C, 80%) + Shooter (20%)~~
    * ~~Lv.2 Seeker (20%C, 70%) + Shooter (10%C, 30%)~~
    * ~~Lv.3 Seeker (10%C, 80%) + Shooter (10%C, 10%) + Turret (10%)~~
    * ~~Lv.4 Seeker (25%C, 70%) + Turret (10%C, 30%)~~
    * ~~Lv.5 Seeker (20%C, 50%) + Turret (20%C, 25%) + Shooter (20%C, 25%)~~
  * ~~Timed Progression~~
    * ~~Lv.0 20s; Lv.1 25s; Lv.2 30s; Lv.3 30s; Lv.4 30/45s; Lv.5 30/45/60s~~
  * ~~Wave Mode~~
    * ~~Max waves: Lv.0 4; Lv.1 4; Lv.2 4-6; Lv.3 6; Lv.4 6; Lv.5 6-8~~
    * ~~Each wave is similar to a timed wave, except spawns are frontloaded rather than separated by time, meaning this benefits AoE and makes dodging harder~~
  * ~~Kill Mode~~
    * ~~Simply spawn N enemies at an interval and end spawning when a certain number is killed, increase speed and overlap of spawns the closer it is to being done~~

I finally did it. I finished everything needed for progression between the game's Lv.0 and Lv.5. Making all these additional nodes was way more annoying than I thought
it would be and I got lost making bad decisions too many times along the way but I think now I made everything as it should be.

The path forward looks like implementing the skill tree and then whatever's necessary to cover Lv.5 to Lv.20~ while also balancing everything along the way.
Tomorrow I'll probably dedicate the day to implementing the mechanics of the skill tree as well as basic initial nodes, and then after that I can start playing the game more
to find the correct numbers for everything.
