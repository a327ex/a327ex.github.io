Ideaguyed all of these and then gave them names and icons. It turns out that to make the mystery skill tree idea work you need A LOT of passives. I'm considering just making it a normal skill tree, implementing these,
then implementing another similar batch, and final one that covers the more varied passives that I already have implemented (fork, chain, pierce, etc), for a total of about 250~ passives. With 250 I could make a pretty
focused skill tree that had very few stat filler nodes.

This all depends on how long I take to implement these 50 though. If I take about 2 days which is what I estimate, then I can do another 3 rounds like this for a total of
~10 days on it. Then I need to spend like 3 or 4 days putting it all together in the skill tree, and then the rest of the time is spent balancing the game and adding extra stuff where needed. What will more likely happen is that
I'll cut it to about ~150 passives, which is roughly the same number as BYTEPATH had, and then go from there.
