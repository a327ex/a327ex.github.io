* Item - a room that grants special items, possible drops:
  * ~~Passive Skill Collapser - force passive skill to be related to a given stat~~
  * ~~Passive Skill Points~~
  * ~~Passive Skill Bypass - access to a tree node without connecting to it~~
  * ~~Passive - just like a tree node except given directly~~
  * Mystery Passive
* Shop
* Rest

Slowly getting back on track. Finished all basic resources for items related to the passive skill tree and so I'm almost done with the item room.
The current set up for this room is either: choose between 3 passives, choose between 3 resource passives and simply get multiple skill points.
The additional thing missing is making some passives mystery ones, which I'll tackle tomorrow.

Now that I have a fairly good idea of what I want the game to be I decided to cut classes for the demo and focus entirely on the skill tree.
The skill tree is the most marketable part of the game and because I need the demo to build wishlists, I definitely need the skill tree and I don't really need the classes,
so to keep my schedule on some kind of check I just decided to cut it. Depending on how people respond to the demo and how much time I have left I'll have to see what to do
about classes, but I'm not sure if they're a priority anymore.
