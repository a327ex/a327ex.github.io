* ~~Node type placement in overmap~~
  * ~~Shop nodes~~
  * ~~Item nodes~~
  * ~~Challenge nodes~~
  * ~~Rest nodes~~
  * ~~Enemy nodes~~
  * ~~Unknown nodes~~

Worked on less stuff than I was expecting to today but at least all node types for the overmap are defined. 
Still haven't worked on how I'm going to present it visually but at least the colors seem nice and the nodes themselves aren't too ugly. 
Should add some text by each special node (and figure out where to place the text based on neighbor positions) and then `InfoText` activation on hover, like I did for BUILDRX.
