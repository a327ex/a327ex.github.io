Finished the initial engine refactor based on what I learned so far from making the current game. The rest of the refactor will have to come from actually just testing things out on a real game,
and since I'm not doing the refactor in the same repository as this game it will be something else. So I lightly started on a rewrite of JUGGLRX to achieve this, as it's a small enough codebase that also
has some meat to it, so it should be a good test subject.
