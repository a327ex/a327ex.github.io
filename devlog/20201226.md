Set up my [Substack](https://a327ex.substack.com/), wrote [a post](https://a327ex.substack.com/p/borders-vs-no-borders), 
and then made [my site](https://a327ex.github.io/) using a simple [Hugo theme](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/cupper-hugo-theme).
Overall it works well but now I have to work primarily on vim rather than on Clover and it makes me lose one of the main benefits of using Clover which is the WYSIWYG component.

I am definitely not going to keep working there and then porting stuff over here every day. 
The main feature I was using there daily was the daily notes thing anyways and I think I can just find some kind of plugin for this on vim anyway.

Still some details to work out on the site, like an automation script for updating and some small aesthetic issues, 
but I'll leave that for some point in the future. Now that webdev stuff is mostly over I can stop procrastinating on the game and go back to it tomorrow.
