Spent the past 2 days playing games without feeling guilty about it because I did it after finishing all my work in the main game. That feels really good.
I also spent a lot of that time thinking about how I wanna proceed with this game and I decided that I will cut all the content that would make it take too much
longer to make, and just finish it before February is done. If I finish it say February 28th, I still have to wait 2 weeks until I can release it, and if I release
by mid March that will already have been 3 months since I started working on it, which is 1 month more than I wanted to take on this game.

I'm going to keep myself to my 2 month goal as best as possible from now on and I'll just consider this game a failure in scoping. I'll try to finish it way before
Feb 28th, but I think it's fair to give myself at least until then to close it completely.

So in the end the game will have 1 floor, like maybe 6 different kinds of rooms other than the normal ones, 3 enemies for now but I can aim for about 8, 2 mini bosses for now
but I can aim for 4, 60 something passives but I can likely aim for double that, and the skill tree will likely have around 200-300 nodes, with the player being able to
maybe buy ~50 of those in each run. This is a fairly smaller scope than what I was aiming for but I guess I'm just not as fast as I thought yet. But 1 more month for this
seems actually doable, even 2 weeks seems like it could be done if I work hard enough.

In any case, to get back on track slowly today I simply designed the first part of the tree and it looks like this:

Tomorrow I'll focus on implementing this in the game.
