Spent the day refactoring part of my engine. This refactor can't be used for the current game because while it doesn't change much of the engine's internals,
it does change most of the part that touches on gameplay code. Essentially the addition of a Node class where the entire game is run from a root node means
that lots object management things have to be different and it's impossible to make those not end up changing gameplay code.

The refactor will likely take a few more days before it's done so I'll keep doing it on the side with the main game,
I just got carried away today with it and didn't do anything on the game.
