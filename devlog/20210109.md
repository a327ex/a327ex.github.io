Added these 15 extra stat based passives, for a total of 55 now. I want to add 5 more tomorrow and then be done with adding passives for the demo, although I'll probably add 10-15 more based on need alone,
since after I playtest the game it'll probably be lacking in some way in the passive department. I finally decided on which stat will be the 5th too, and I ended up going with "Morph", which I have a cool idea for but that I don't want to make public so I won't go into details here.

Tomorrow I should add the extra 5 passives and then start working on the game's progression. I'll focus on Lv.0 through 5, which will force me to add the Item, Shop and Arena rooms. The Item room is fairly
simple, you go in and pick up a new passive. Shop room will have multiple types of things you can buy, like temporary passives, upgrades to existing passives, and so on. Slay the Spire and One Step From Eden
both have good ideas for what a shop should be. And the Arena room I still haven't decided. I'll probably make it a mini-boss room, and make the Challenge room like challenge rooms in Isaac, with tiered
challenges that spawn one after another.

Oh yea, I also added comments to this site using [utterances](https://utteranc.es/). It was fairly easy and painless, and I realized that when I port my posts from the github blog I can also probably port
the comments using this tool too.
