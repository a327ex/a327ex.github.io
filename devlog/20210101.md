# 20210101

Spent most of the day remaking the site with only HTML and CSS and it worked out great.
Still have lots of stuff to do but for the most part it's looking good enough for me and adding new content is just a matter of copypasting a bunch of stuff for each page.

In the future I want to add a dark mode, maybe change the back/forwards arrows, and get started on porting a few blog posts here so I can work out the details when there's code highlighting in the post.
But I'll do this very slowly over time and focus more on the game now. In any case, it's pretty refreshing to not have to use any additional tools to run the site and I feel like I have much more control
over what the fuck is going on in any single page, which is great.
