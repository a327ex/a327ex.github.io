Not much done today, mostly small additions and fixing of various details. I also played the game quite a bit with all the passives it has now and it already feels pretty good to combine them.
I feel even more confident in this game after this and it seems pretty clear to me that I really just need to sit down and work more and I'll be able to make something that I'm very happy with releasing.

I was going to add more passives today but ended only adding the homing one, which works pretty well after trying out different ways of doing it and settling on just using a function that I already
made for situations like this in the past: `rotate_towards_object`. Making these general game object movement functions has paid off tremendously over time and I wonder what kinds of functions that
I haven't generalized yet that I'm missing on because I just didn't stop to pay attention to it.

As I already mentioned in a previous post, there's a general pattern arising with all the `hit_flash` effects, but I bet if when this game is done and I take the time to actually study the codebase
I'll find many more instances of things that can be easily generalizable into very useful functions like `rotate_towards_object` that have appeared in basically every prototype I've made since BYTEPATH.
