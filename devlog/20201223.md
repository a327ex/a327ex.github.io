* ~~EnemySpawn effect~~
* ~~Win condition~~
  * ~~Time~~
* ~~Transition back to overmap~~

Managed to get transition to overmap working so now the game loop is functional to the degree that each node is implemented. 
I'm going to implement other win conditions later and focus on making sure that one win condition works well for most situations as I implement different nodes, 
passives, passive distribution, basically the rest of the game.
