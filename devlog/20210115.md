Spent yesterday and today trying to make the Worm mini-boss for the arena work but couldn't do it in a way I was happy with. I'll give it a go again tomorrow but if it isn't immediately clear
that what I try next is something that'll work I'll just make another easier mini-boss instead. It's probably a good idea to focus overall on mini-bosses that are single entities spamming
projectiles rather than having too complex behaviors anyways, otherwise I'm just gonna spend too much time on each, like I have for this one already.
