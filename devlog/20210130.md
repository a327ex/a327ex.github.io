Got some nodes into the tree and spent more time actually doing some preparation work necessary for the code to function as it should.
Essentially the way nodes collapse into their results (for nodes that can be either stat 1 or stat 2, which one does it end up being?) wasn't being correctly reflected in multiple
parts of the skill tree and how it was displayed to the player, and now that work is almost complete. Will continue on that tomorrow as well.
