Added 7 passives, making the game now have a total of 40. Out of these passives there's a question of how to make some of them combine with each other and existing ones. For instance, the Shotgun passive
makes it so that the projectiles fired slow down and then expire over 0.5-1 seconds. This poses a problem for a passive like Orbit, which relies on projectiles living until they hit a way to have any real
effectiveness. Right now I'm not doing anything about it and players would just learn to not pick up Shotgun with Orbit and vice-versa, but these combinations are easily fixable by just saying that the
Shotgun projectiles' duration should be increased if the player also has the Orbit passive. 

Another example is the Radiation passive combined with Telekinesis, which allows the player to spawn lots of the projectiles on the screen because Telekinesis only makes the projectile move after the
player releases the attack button, and the Radiation passive continually makes each projectile spawn secondary projectiles, meaning that if you have both you can flood the screen with secondary projectiles
endlessly. The "fix" for this is making it so that Telekinesis projectiles automatically release themselves after a duration, like 4s, which is the way this kind of passive works in Isaac, for example.

In any case, I think what I'll end up doing is just playing the game a lot eventually and as I find combinations that don't work well but that I think should work well I'll implement a special case for it
and see where it goes. This will make the code more complicated but there's a lot of cool combinations that should work properly and if they don't come out of the code naturally then I guess I have to force it.
