Finished an initial JUGGLRX rewrite, removing anything that I'm not sure I want the game to have anymore.
Overall the engine refactor went easier than I expected and it seems like everything is working out fine so far.

Still have some more constructs to generalize from SHOOTRX, like overmap/skill tree which share a lot of similar code that's currently repeated and could be made into a proper module,
but other than that everything I wanted to do is done. Genuinely feel like this is the happiest I've been with my codebase since I started making games.
