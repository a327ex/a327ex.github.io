    * ~~Simply spawn N enemies at an interval and end spawning when a certain number is killed, increase speed and overlap of spawns the closer it is to being done~~

Only things missing from this big list now are Item and Shop rooms. Today was a good day because I realized that I could change the way timers work to handle any conditionals at all
and the possibilities of this are actually endless. Because of the way this game was coded and the way the engine works now this has limited utility for this game (but it helps a lot still),
but for the next game I intend on spending some time reorganizing the engine to take full advantage of this.

I believe that the best way to go is to have a core `Node` object which will work similarly to Amulet's, in that everything is a Node and nodes can be composed together in various
ways to achieve everything that's necessary in a game. These node objects will have the full timer functionality, so each node can do things based on timers or conditions, and each node
can be defined entirely from a single place, meaning that I can define objects directly in a function, return that object, and then the caller composes that with its own nodes in whatever
way it sees fit. This goes up to the root node object, and then you have the node graph situation that happens with Amulet too.

I feel like this mechanism coupled with the new timer's abilities should enable literally everything that's needed in a game in a very cool way, and the end user, future me, that is,
won't have to worry about handling objects in quite the same way anymore, since now everything can be in their own functions and the code can actually be fairly descriptive in terms
of what's actually happening, instead of objects calling objects calling objects in a fairly opaque way.
