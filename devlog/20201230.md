* ~~Modal passive distribution screen~~
  * ~~Passive card~~
    * ~~Icon~~
    * ~~Text~~
    * ~~Hover selection~~
    * ~~Click selection~~
  * ~~Create cards from passive pool~~
  * ~~Destroy cards on passive selection~~
  * ~~Call transition effect~~

Passive screen now works and technically now the loop is finally complete, it's just a matter of adding lots of variation to it. 
This is generally where most of my games die and I guess we'll see what happens.

I ended up finishing this fairly early in the day and will spend the rest of it as well as tomorrow trying to make a small video compilation of all the dev things I did this year. 
I was looking at my media folder to see if I even had enough stuff to warrant something like this and it turns out that I worked on like 6+ different games this year and I forgot about like half of them. 
So there should be enough for at least like a 1 min video or something.
