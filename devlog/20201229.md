Got passives working today and ended up implementing 4 of them to also test their placement on the screen. 
Even with just these few passives gameplay is already getting more interesting and I can imagine a number of extra enemy types that would likely make it even better.

Also I don't know yet if I want both secondary attack and special to be swappable in a run or if the player is stuck with them and there's different characters available at the start. 
I think a good way to decide this is to just implement more of the game and see how progression feels. 
I have a feeling things are going to feel fairly samey at some point and more in-run variation is going to be necessary, and variable secondary attacks would be a good one to have.

Tomorrow I'll probably spend most of the time working on the passive selection modal, and if I finish that early then the next thing should be adding a few more passives, up to like 10-12, 
and then make other types of rooms that can appear up to level 5, like arenas, shops and items. 
After all these are done I can get a pretty good feel for how the power level of the player progresses between level 1-5 and how powerful I want enemies to be, and what kinds of enemies I want to add.
