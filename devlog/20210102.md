Implemented most `contact` type passives, the only one missing is the Phase one, which I'll get to when/if I add solids in the middle of the map.
If I were actually working fast and in a focused manner I could have done both contact and creation type passives today, but I was fairly unfocused and paying attention to other stuff.

One cool thing I was thinking about today was [this](https://github.com/onivim/oni2), which is a vim-like editor that supports VsCode plugins.
I found it by total accident and it seems really exciting. I'll probably give it a try tomorrow.

Another thing that I've been thinking about more recently is trying out Linux again. When I first tried it it was basically 10 years ago and I spent 3-4 years using Arch Linux primarily.
It was a fairly cool experience but I decided to be pragmatic and switch to Windows at some point because it takes some maintenance time out of you that's annoying to deal with if you're not in the mindset.

However, I currently find myself in the mindset of dealing with all that, for some reason, so maybe it makes sense to give it a try again. The only problem is that there's no ShareX alternative
for Linux that lets me record gifs/videos of a section of the screen easily. But since lately I've been mostly recording the entire screen with OBS only maybe it wouldn't be a big deal.
Either way, I don't know when I'll give it a try. Setting up my machine would be essentially a week-long process since I also wanna try out [awesome](https://awesomewm.org/index.html) again,
especially now that I know Lua so much better, so yea. Should probably get to it in the future but not the super near future.

And finally, I found this [cool site](https://lunchbag.ca/) which gave me a few ideas to steal to use and improve on this site. I was also thinking about how I'll proceed with this site and if
I'll keep using/updating it or not, and essentially I came to the conclusion that I should stop using my github blog, stop using my newly created Substack (rip), and just move everything here.

The only reason I created the Substack was for e-mail notifications, but I should be able to get that going on this site in an automated manner. 
The only reason I have the github blog is because I don't have to manage anything, but if I'm going to manage this site at all then it makes no sense to keep posting stuff there. 

What I'm going to do over time is improve the tooling (currently only HTML + CSS), probably using something like [etlua](https://github.com/leafo/etlua) as a simple templating language to 
build the site more automatically, and then also [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert all GitHub Markdown posts from the github blog to here. This should be easier to do properly
than when I tried before because now I have like 20 posts (this one included) outlining what each HTML element should look like, so I just have to make sure that the conversion adheres to that.
