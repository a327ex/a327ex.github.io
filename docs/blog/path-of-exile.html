title: Thoughts on Path of Exile

<p>Path of Exile is one of my favorite games. I have about 1.7k hours on it on Steam and it's the one game I've played the most there. The only game I think that managed to hook me for more time than this was probably the main MMO I played when I was younger which was called FlyFF.</p>
<p>I really super like this game, but the more I play the more its design mistakes become apparent to me, so I thought I'd write about it. Also, calling these things "design mistakes" is maybe a bit too far, they're more like differences in preference rather than objective mistakes or anything like that.</p>
<h2 id="specialization-and-socialization">Specialization and Socialization</h2>
<p>One of the main problems I have with PoE is the lack of specialization. To cut it short, every player can do everything that the game has available, and the only thing preventing them from doing it is their annoyance resistance and time.</p>
<p>In MMOs, not all content can be done by all players because MMOs are about socialization, so designers for those games are fine with forcing people to party up to handle different types of content. PoE is mostly a solo game that also has MMO properties, but because it doesn't want to go in that direction too much it means that the designers are bound to making everything accessible to everyone. But they can't entirely let everyone access everything otherwise the game would have no challenge, so they have to find various ways of making the semi-MMO game that is PoE into a harder one, and they do that via annoyance.</p>
<p>Think of trading. It's well known that the developers don't want to make trading easier because it would make the game too trivial for the average player. This is probably factually the case. But this is only the case because the developers don't want to make the game a proper MMO. Consider the following arrangement:</p>
<h3 id="the-city">The city</h3>
<p>There's a city where all trading happens. No more APIs, no more hideouts. There's no automated market either. People just trade in a city with their AFK shops and players have to go around the city to find the things they want. This change alone would do two things: the first is that it would slow down trading dramatically compared to now, which is what the developers want, and the second is that it would introduce a shared environment, the city, to the game. Once you have a shared environment a lot of things become possible.</p>
<p>For instance, people who want to flip items can now go through the city, looking for underpriced items and buying them all up, and then selling it on their shops. But they can't do it as fast as they could before because now they have to physically go through what would be a fairly big city.</p>
<p>As a developer you could also now create specific classes that focus on various aspects of trading like this. Like one class could have you let bigger shop signs, or could specialize in selling and buying specific types of items, or letting you buy items with money you don't have to pay with interest later (so you could flip in higher quantities in the short term), etc.</p>
<p>This one change alone, of simply making the game more like an MMO, would already introduce a lot of specialization and variety of gameplay, while also fixing the problem that the developers of the game want to fix. Of course, this will never happen with PoE. A city with thousands of characters simply can't happen in their engine because of all the MTX they have, so sadly this solution is unavailable to them.</p>
<h3 id="crafting">Crafting</h3>
<p>But imagine solutions like this, except for every other aspect of the game as well. PoE has a huge and complex crafting system with tons of content that touches on it from all directions. It is unironically very complicated and I really don't like it because I don't like crafting in general. But it's fine because I can just buy items from the market.</p>
<p>For the people who do like it though, a city like this would also benefit them. Now instead of playing the game they could just focus their gameplay entirely on the city, crafting items for other players to buy because they have a greater understanding of the game AND because they have specific classes that let them craft things that other players can't.</p>
<p>Again, instead of adding crafting content to EVERY league, making it more like an MMO would enable the developers to gate crafting content behind different classes and thus would increase specialization.</p>
<h3 id="socialization">Socialization</h3>
<p>The more general rule is that PoE's problems come from the fact that it's a single player game that is also a semi-MMO. And most of its problems would be fixed by making it a real MMO instead. The main thing that prevents PoE from being a real MMO is the fact that there's no sense of shared environment. A city everyone uses would fix that.</p>
<p>The more socialization you have, the more of a natural barrier you have to gate content behind, because then it becomes a game of collective coordination rather than a game of individual autism. The more collectively organized guilds with better specialization distribution (and with more time sunk in the game) would be able to create items and access content that other people wouldn't, and that would make the game an actual social game, with drama, politics, infighting, etc.</p>
<p>Now, as I said before, this isn't necessarily a design mistake by PoE's developers. They probably don't want their game to be an MMO like this, and I'd bet that a huge portion of the players also don't. But I personally can easily see a path from it to an MMO, and that path fixing most of these issues I just described.</p>
<p>One MMO that I really liked recently was Tree of Savior simply because of the sheer amount of classes it had, including non-combat ones. I think a game of PoE's complexity that focused more on non-combat roles could easily become something like the greatest MMO ever, and it's something I think people are really waiting for but no one manages to do it properly...</p>
<h2 id="action-and-stat-checks">Action and Stat Checks</h2>
<p>The second main problem I have with PoE is that it's also a semi-action game. What I mean by this is that it is an action game but it's also a stat check RPG. When you're fighting a monster you're not only fighting this monster in 2D space, you're also fighting it with your stats. This is the case for most RPG games like this, but most of these games have the boundaries between these two elements way more clearly delineated than PoE does.</p>
<p>Because of PoE's speed it feels like it primarily is an action game, but it is in fact primarily a stat checking game. An easy way to think about this is to answer this question: can an experienced PoE player beat the final boss as a level 1 character with no equipment, like it can be done in a game like Dark Souls? The answer to that is a really big no.</p>
<p>There's no inherent problem with this arrangement, every RPG is like this. But again, the game feels very much like an action game, the bosses have mechanics that feel like you should be able to dodge them, the game has content that forces you to dodge things or you will die a painful death (i.e the lab). It operates in this weird middle ground between an action game and an RPG in a way that very few other games do, I think.</p>
<p>The result of this is that once you're far enough into the game, you're either failing the stat check or you aren't. And if you're failing it you just... die. And it tends to happen very fast. Because of how the game's action, speed and stat checks are structured there's no way around this. The way the game has of telling you you failed is killing you immediately.</p>
<p>There are several problems with this, but I'm also not going to dwell on them. The question is how to do things differently so that this isn't the case.</p>
<h3 id="action">Action</h3>
<p>The obvious solution here is to either make the game a more proper action game, or to make it a more proper stat check game.</p>
<p>The action game would look like a game where you can actually dodge things. If an enemy shoots a projectile you can see the projectile and get out of the way. If an enemy does a melee attack you can see the enemy winding up and either defend or get out of the way. This would turn the game into something else that isn't an ARPG because it would make the game way slower and you wouldn't be able to play it mindlessly.</p>
<p>There isn't necessarily a problem with the game being slower, and this is something PoE devs seem to actively want. But there's definitely something to being able to play the game without thinking, and making it too action oriented would take that away.</p>
<p>There are a few games that manage to strike this balance in a way better way than PoE, in my opinion. For instance, Risk of Rain 2. RoR2 is a game that manages to be a fairly heavy action oriented game but where your stats also matter a fair bit. The only difference is that the level of customization offered in RoR2 is way lower than in PoE, and thus the developer has more control over how the game feels, which allows for more control over the "are you failing the stat check" question and its failure mode instantly killing you or not.</p>
<h3 id="stat-checking">Stat checking</h3>
<p>The stat check game would look like a game where dodging literally doesn't matter. Combat happens by enemies locking onto you and you locking onto them, and then either melee or ranged attacks happen and they connect or not depending solely on stats. Most MMOs are like this, and I have an easier time imagining an ARPG that is also like this.</p>
<p>One of the obvious benefits of a game that isn't lying about being about stat checking is that you can make it slower, but you can also keep it a fairly simple game that doesn't require any of your brain. Would it make the game slightly more boring and less impressive? Yes. But I think there are multiple things you could do as a designer to keep PoE's impact intact as much as possible.</p>
<p>For instance, even though now you'd be taking, say, 5 times as many hits to kill an enemy as you do currently, why not make the number of enemies you can kill at once also 5 times higher? Many MMOs in the past focused heavily on huge amounts of AoEing, and while PoE does an extremely good job at this, their engine seems like it chokes way too easily for one reason or another when the number of enemies starts increasing, so there's a lot of improvement possible there.</p>
<p>Similarly, a more heavily stat checking game could also enable lenghtier 1v1 fights and thus it could also enable 1v1 levelling. One of the things that's generally possible in MMOs is killing higher level monsters for way more XP. In a game like PoE this doesn't make much sense because the fights happen too fast so you'd just get killed instantly, but in a slower stat checking game the player would have enough time to react and to effectively engage with each fight better.</p>
<p>In any case, I can easily see a more heavily stat checking and slower game working for PoE, and while I don't really think they'll go in this direction it's an interesting direction regardless. Tree of Savior I think strikes a good balance between speed, AoEing and stat checking. The only mistake ToS made was using an "AoE ratio" stat, which dictates how many enemies you can hit at the same time. This is obviously outrageous and shouldn't be in any game, and if ToS had somewhat bigger spawns as well as no AoE ratio stat then it would strike the actual perfect balance in this regard.</p>
<h2 id="mmo">MMO</h2>
<p>To finalize, essentially what I'm arguing for is that PoE should become more like an MMO. I deeply believe that a game with PoE's system complexity that was made into an actual MMO would be an absolutely huge success. There's literally no MMO out there that comes close to having the complexity that PoE has, and imagining a game like that that also expands that complexity to cover non-combat roles makes me extremely excited.</p>
<p>I described this game I'm imagining in more detail <a href="https://a327ex.github.io/blog/game-ideas" target="_blank">here</a> and it's just one of those ideas that I want to work on one day.</p>
