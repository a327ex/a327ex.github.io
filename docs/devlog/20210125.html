<p>Nothing too exciting, just got transition to the skill tree screen done as well as the very basics of skill tree logic. Right now nodes can be added to it from the base skill tree table and you can buy new ones and it follows the logic that a skill tree shoudl have, like not being able to buy disconnected nodes.</p>
<p>Other than that the only thing that got my attention today devwise was <a href="https://github.com/ExOK/Celeste2" target="_blank">this</a>. I have no idea how PICO-8 works but I thought this code was very well organized and logical. It gave me a bunch of ideas for how I want to change my own engine.</p>
<p>And speaking of that, I feel like I'm pretty confident now doing a set amount of progress on the main game every day, since everything is pretty much set in stone and it's a matter of grinding it out, that I should add another project on top of it. So starting tomorrow I'll probably try to divide my time between the main game and the changing of my engine, which is something that has been in my head since I got the idea for conditional timers a few days ago.</p>
<p>I still don't know exactly where I want to go with this refactor so I need to explore a few different things first.</p>
