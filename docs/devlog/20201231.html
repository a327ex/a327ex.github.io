<h1 id="20201231">20201231</h1>
<p>Spent the early part of the day making a 2020 dev compilation. Essentially I just looked into my media folder and took out the most interesting webms, gifs and mp4s that I recorded since the start of the year. Anything that wasn't recorded or that I didn't post online didn't make it, so sadly there's a few shorter projects that there's no videos of, but overall there was a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>In total it was 52 videos, and then I converted all gifs to mp4s since the video editor didn't take gifs in properly, and I did it with this command: <code>ffmpeg -f gif -i 1.gif 1.mp4</code>. After this it was just a matter of putting all clips together using <a href="https://www.openshot.org/" target="_blank">this video editor</a> and it turned out to be way easier than I remember.</p>
<p>I also used this editor to make BYTEPATH's trailer and I remember it being a pretty poor experience. This time though it went pretty smoothly. I think it was because this time it was literally just stitching videos together and trimming them slightly, whereas for the trailer I was trimming like hours of gameplay in the editor itself as well as adding transforms to zoom the video in specific places.</p>
<p>It seems like it works better if all the gameplay footage is cut and zoomed beforehand, and then just stitched together in the editor, which makes sense, but leaves less room for recording, since you can't just record yourself playing the game for hours and then picking out the cool things that happened, or you can but you'd have to use another tool to do it beforehand, which would defeat the purpose.</p>
<p><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.3%; margin-top: -0.55em;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A7_o8cFOi6o?rel=0&playlist=A7_o8cFOi6o&loop=1&modestbranding=1&autoplay=1" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div><br></p>
<p>After all this was done I started playing around with the site again. While I'm happy with the way this site is now, I really dislike the tooling behind it and I sort of want it to not be there. I saw <a href="https://justine.lol/index.html" target="_blank">this page</a> and it inspired me to try making something simpler, and so now I'm trying to make something entirely in HTML + CSS, no markdown or any other complexities, and just seeing how it goes. I'll probably spend most of tomorrow doing this.</p>
