<p>After how successful JUGGLRX's rewrite was and how much I like the engine now I decided to rewrite the game in it. There are multiple reasons for it. The first one is that while MoonScript is a cool language I'm kinda over it. It has lots of cosmetic advantages over Lua but fundamentally it's the same language, and at the end of the day writing code in it is just one step removed from writing Lua code with a few conveniences added. These conveniences aren't huge enough for me to justify the added step, so I think I just want to be done with it.</p>
<p>The second reason is that I came to the conclusion that there are 3 big changes I need to do the game: skill tree rework to the more traditional tree rather than this mystery tree concept that ended up not really working, stat rework to unify and normalize all passives and their stat bonuses, and other general improvements that the game can benefit from the engine rework.</p>
<p>The skill tree rework can also be made into a more general module for skill tree-like things, which the game has in the form of both the skill tree and the overmap and there's a lot of copypasted code for those 2 states. This also helps for my next game which will also have a node-based overmap (but not randomly generated) and there I will be able to make use of this same structure.</p>
<p>The stat rework also touches on a fair amount of code on Player, Projectile and Enemy objects and while most code for those objects will just be repeated, these stat changes will probably go over better and with less failure on a full rewrite. And the other general improvements from the engine mostly have to do with setting up the different states the game has correctly rather than in the sort of hacky way they are setup currently, and a lot less code repetition on common constructs like hit effects.</p>
