<p>Got more stuff done today regarding the tree. Now it works completely and it's just a matter of actually making the tree itself. This was a lot easier than it was for BYTEPATH's tree because I got to copy 90% of the code I already wrote for overmap, which is a graph too. Tomorrow I'll probably take a break, relax a little and play some games, since now I've officially finished all the systems in the game and from here on it's a matter of adding content gradually.</p>
<p>Regarding the timeframe for this game, it would be neat if I could finish it entirely by Feb 15th, which would keep it within the 2 months time that I want, and then I'd use the next 2 weeks for marketing and wishlist building. I'll aim for that but I'm thinking it's very unlikely to happen unless I cut a lot of content that I have in mind for the game. Maybe that's what I'll actually do because I really don't want this game to prolong itself too much. I kind of want to respect the 2 months limit as much as I can. The fact that I failed to make my vision for the game work within these 2 months entirely means I'm still too inexperienced and I should have picked something even smaller, and that fact then doesn't give me the right to extend the game even further beyond the 2 months limit, however tempting it seems.</p>
