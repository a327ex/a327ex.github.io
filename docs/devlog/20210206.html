<p>Got a lot of passives done today. These kinds of passives really are as easy to add as I thought so I can probably do another batch of 50~ or so after this with no problems. I already have a few ideas for some additional gameplay mechanics that weren't covered by the first 60~ more varied passives before these, so after the next 50~ batch I can probably do another batch of more varied ones that enable different kinds of builds rather than just conditional stat types of passives like these. Either way I like this speed, hopefully I can keep it up.</p>
