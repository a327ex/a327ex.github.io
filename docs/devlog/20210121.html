<p>I didn't do anything yesterday and I also didn't do much today. I tried implementing an inventory/grid system for passive selection that I had an idea for but I gave up on it after I realized that I was just doing this aimlessly and with no real purpose. So essentially I stopped working and was considering this to be another dead day but luckily I had a very good idea for tying the game up both thematically and gameplay wise and this essentially means that I now know with 100% certainty what I want the game to be and what I need to do to make it happen.</p>
<p>I feel like most of the times where I stop and don't feel like working it's because I actually don't agree that I should keep working on this idea and that it needs to change. Previously I interpreted these signals as needing to change the entire game, and that's partly why I would work on a game for like ~1 month and then stop it entirely and work or something else. Now I'm much more committed to this game and dropping it doesn't seem like an option, however I very much felt yesterday and today as those sorts of low progress days that precede me dropping a project, but I just essentially finished the project in terms of ideas and now it's literaly a matter of implementing it.</p>
<p>This feels rambly but I guess the point is, as <a href="https://twitter.com/baroquedecay/status/1352141839416098816" target="_blank">this guy says</a>, it probably pays to more readily identify when I reach a point where I don't know what to do next, and take a break (without feeling guilty) to reassess what exactly needs to be done and where the game should go from here. Looking back on it now it seems pretty clear to me that most of the times I dropped a project before, it happened exactly because of this problem of not knowing where the project is going, and not having a good enough idea to replace whatever I was doing currently.</p>
<p>I guess this is also one of the drawbacks of choosing ideas that are slightly larger than they should be, which is that there are more ways for you to get lost, since there are more elements that make up the game and each element can be any number of things that you have to decide on and the more of those there are, the higher the likelihood that things will feel wrong and the higher the amounts of time where I'll have no idea where to go next because the current thing isn't working.</p>
