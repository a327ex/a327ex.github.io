## Anime PoE MMO

A game very similar to Path of Exile but anime styled, with the visual ideal being something like [Tree of Savior](https://store.steampowered.com/app/372000/Tree_of_Savior_English_Ver/).

### City/hub

While PoE is one of my favorite games and I could spend a lot of words pointing out all the things it does right, part of the motivation for an anime-style PoE comes from
the few things PoE doesn't do because the developers have a different interest than me. These things are not necessarily wrong, they're just different focuses.
I like MMOs a lot and so I can see an MMO in PoE with a few very small changes.

The smallest change possible to be made to PoE that could make it into an MMO would be having a global shared city/hub for activities other than killing monsters instead of 
each player being in his own hideout/instance. PoE wasn't built with doing this in mind so this isn't possible to be done in it. The reasons for that are multiple,
with the main one being all the crazy cosmetics that would make it impossible to load everything in a city with hundreds or thousands of players.

A game made from the ground up with this in mind would be able to do it, and so if I were to think of this as "suppose you could build a game exactly
like PoE in terms of gameplay quality/complexity and also in terms of visual quality (but anime-styled), how would you attack it and bring as many PoE
players to your game as possible?", this city/hub idea would be the main thing to focus on.

As a side note, this way of thinking is clearly mistaken and wrong,
in reality another ARPG/MMO as good as PoE that was anime-styled wouldn't really steal players from it I don't think because people have very strong reactions to anime,
either positively or negatively. What would more likely happen is just a bunch of people who never got into PoE because it was too grim dark getting into the anime
game because it's anime, even though it's essentially the same thing gameplay wise.

In any case, even assuming that everything else about the game is the same, the game with the city would already feel like an MMO,
because PoE already is kind of an MMO since it has an economy. The only reason it doesn't really feel like one is because there's no sense of shared environment,
which this change would fix.

### Classes

One of the things I really don't like about PoE is its focus on crafting. I know that it's an ARPG and that items with tons of mods and with tons of crafting
possibilities is one of its main points, but I personally just don't like that gameplay. I can avoid it by just buying already crafted items, but it feels
wrong, given that pretty much every league has a focus on crafting different types of items. So if I want to interact with each league fully I pretty much
have to understand how the game's crafting system works.

This is a problem that has been solved by many MMOs already and it's solved with classes. If someone only likes killing monsters, that's what they should focus on.
If someone only likes trading, that's what they should focus on. If someone only likes crafting, that's what they should focus on. MMOs can be played in many different
ways and people should focus on the way they like playing, and the game should support that. So tons of MMOs have classes that have specific non-combat related specialties.

In a game with a city/hub where trading happens in real space rather than through an API, you can imagine adventurers coming from spending lots of time grinding their maps
and selling their found materials to all sorts crafters, like alchemists, blacksmiths, chefs, herbalists, etc, and then those players would spend their time crafting
those materials into better items which the adventurers would use to face more challenging content, and bring better items and so on.

An economy like this could be enabled
in the city and it would make the game feel even more like an MMO, and players like me, who don't really like crafting, wouldn't be forced to, because there are people
who's specific job is crafting things. Of course, all of those crafting jobs would have to be somewhat interesting on their own, and that would likely take some effort, but
it's not something too crazy to imagine.

### World

The final change I would focus on, but this one is likely harder to make work properly, is to instead of having players go through maps like in PoE, they go through a fixed,
very large and unexplored world. This world would be filled with enemies such that at high levels one would be zooming through the map as fast as players do in PoE,
but the world would be so massive in scale that it would support lots of players doing this simultaneously.

The effects of having a huge unexplored world makes for a lot of additional possibilities. Now we can have classes like cartographers, which are concerned with mapping out
this huge world in a coherent way and selling their maps to other players, crafters, hunters, etc. Normal adventurers also have an incentive to share/sell information to
cartographers about different spawns of enemies, minerals, bosses, etc.

You could also have classes like wayfarers, who are concerned with creating portals between different places so adventurers don't have to walk all the way from their grinding
spots to the city and back. You could have classes like squires, who could either be able to setup camps outside the main city, or who could serve as servants for other players,grabbing items from the city for them so they don't have to walk back, and so on.

The main idea is that the city is in the center of the map, and the map expands outwards with enemies all around the city, growing in difficulty the further away you get.
The map would be procedurally generated and it would be absolutely massive. Just like in PoE there would be little to no quests, and players would simply focus on grinding
out the game, getting more materials/currency, coming back to the city to trade so they can be more powerful, repeat.

This change would turn the game into a proper MMO because now not only is the city a shared environment, but the world also is one. This is obviously harder to accomplish,
especially with a really big procedurally generated world, but I think it's doable in the very far future once I'm much more experienced as a developer. This also doesn't
cost much in terms of content. PoE is a game that has lots of content, but a huge portion of it can be made much simpler once you have proper delineations between different
kinds of classes.

For instance, the labyrinth. The labyrinth is a piece of content that was likely pretty hard to make for them and not many people like it. Yet, because they spent so much
time doing it, they sort of had to force it on everyone. In anime PoE, lab-like dungeons can be done in such a way that they can only be run by specific
classes, like say treasure hunters, and then no one has to interact with it, other than people who really enjoy that content. Basically every league PoE has that people have
strong aversions to can be made into class specific content so that the people who like that kind of thing can willingly choose to do it and get rewarded for it in a way
that others can't. All of this content can then be made much cheaper, because it doesn't have to justify itself to the rest of the playerbase.

### Annoyance

More generally, PoE has the following problem aptly pointed out by some redditors:

<img class="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/a8Nn0Rx.png"></img>

The way PoE devs decided to limit access to content is through annoyance, and this happens everywhere in the game, from trading to crafting to ascending your character.
If they didn't do this people would get too powerful too fast, and the game would be trivially easy. And if they didn't have the ability for people to get powerful in
the first place the game would be boring.

The general solution to this problem, in my view, is more specialization and more socialization. In our society, getting more "powerful" is also annoying,
but people can freely choose how exactly they want to be annoyed by the profession they pick. I chose game development because I like it,
and I can deal with all of its annoyances because of that. And when I produce something of high value, like a really good video game, people will be able to trade with me
for the things of value they built instead.

PoE is moving towards this direction by allowing people to focus on different aspects of the game in their end game content, but it's a bandaid fix.
The fundamental issue is that the game has no clearly defined specializations, which means that anyone can do anything, and so like the post mentioned you can get people
who do really crazy stuff and deal with all the annoyance the game puts in their path, and you also get people who don't want to deal with any of that (me) who miss out
on it.

Specialization fixes this by saying: you can only get this crazy thing if you're this specific class, and if you're this specific class you're giving up being another
specific class that would allow you to do another thing better. So if someone wants to do crazy crafts, they pick one of the classes that lets you do crazy crafts,
but that prevents them from picking the class that lets them find crazy materials for their crafts.

This separation of concerns means that individuals are focused on different tasks, and when that happens you introduce a natural barrier to content access.
Now instead of you having to limit trading because it trading was too easy you'd get too powerful characters, trading can happen normally because what limits character
power is coordination between multiple people, since no one person can do everything themselves. This coordination increases socialization, which makes the game
more like an MMO.

So the best guilds are the guilds that have the best coordination between their members, and thus they can craft the best equipment, or find the best hunting spots,
or find the best mining spots, etc. From specialization you get socialization, and from socialization you get a real MMO, and it simultaneously solves the annoyance
problem.

## NGU: Number Go Up!

A game about numbers going up.

### Gameplay Rules

The game is inspired by [Incremental Merge](https://mrredshark77.github.io/incremental-merge/), so things will be described with that in mind.

* You have a pool of numbers, like cards in a card game
* You gain new numbers by waiting or merging numbers during a fight
* When you merge numbers enemies take damage for the given merge (1+1 = 2 damage)
* You have a main number that is your HP
* Enemies are also just numbers and deal damage to your main number over time (not turn based)
* Win condition is generally just killing all enemies in a given room without having your HP drop below 0

### Metagameplay

A roguelite Slay the Spire-like where you go from node to node fighting numbers with your own numbers. Unlike StS, your pool of numbers
is constant throughout the game, meaning you don't renew your numbers every fight. As you go through the map and merge more and more numbers
you get more powerful. While in the first fight you might be merging 1+1, in further fights you might be merging 60+60 by default and so on.

There are rooms where you can increase your number pool without having to wait or merge them in a fight. There are rooms where you can also find
artifacts, items, more HP, etc. In general special items and artifacts might give you various bonuses, like getting more numbers per merge, increasing
the base number of your generated numbers, effects when you deal damage to enemies, when specific types of numbers are merged (like primes), etc.

### Gameplay Elements

* HP
* Number pool
* Damage
* Base number generation (when you generate a number from waiting by default it's 1, you want this to increase as you get more powerful)
* Number generation rate (how fast numbers are generated from waiting)
* Merge number generation rate (generate more than 1 number per merge)
* Number properties: odd/even, primes, numbers that are valid for a certain formula, etc

### Modifiers

* +- HP
* +- damage
* +- base number generation
* +- number generation rate
* +- merge number generation rate
* +- damage on [number property]
* +- damage taken on [number property]
* Deal damage on [event], where [event] = merge, new number generated, damage taken, property reached, etc
* ...

It's pointless to keep listing these here because they just come pretty obviously. The various ways in which you can create interesting
items out of this system is just natural because it's basically just like any turn based card game, and the mechanics for those are endless.

## JUGGLRX

A game about juggling balls.

### Gameplay Rules

* You have 1 or more paddles, and you can switch between them with the 1-4 keys
* If a ball falls you lose 1 HP for the currently selected paddle
* If a paddle loses all its HP it can't be selected again until it's revived
* Paddles have special skills that help with juggling more balls
* Win condition depends on the current map, but might vary between:
  * Juggling `n` balls for a duration
  * Staying alive for a duration
  * Balls hit your paddles `n` times
  * Clearing the map of enemy structures

### Metagameplay

Two possibilities:

Roguelite Slay the Spire-like map, with passives and paddles being found in each node that increasingly make juggling more balls easier.
Examples of those can be found in the modifiers section. This is a pretty standard setup, the only way it works though if it
there are enough gameplay elements and modifiers to be played around with, especially if there are multiple types of builds
available that players can go for. That's still questionable so I don't know if this would work yet.

One Finger Death Punch-like static map, with passives and paddles being found as you explore the map.
The further out you go the bigger the challenge, with different types of nodes focusing on different gameplay elements
and on different skills the player can improve over time. This is the safer option that's less replayable but more controllable and
I should go for it in case I can't think of enough modifiers or paddles to have enough variation for a roguelite.

### Gameplay Elements

* Paddle (each paddle is a class/character)
* Paddle responsiveness
* Ball spawn rate
* Ball overflow limit
* Ball gravity
* HP

### Modifiers

* +- paddle responsiveness
* +- paddle ability cooldown
* +- ball spawn rate
* +- ball overflow limit
* +- ball gravity
* +- HP
* +- [modifier] on hit for `n` hits

Very hard to think up new passives/items for this that make sense and seem actually interesting. Perhaps thinking more about terms of
paddle's active skills and how parts of them could be used as passives might help? Either way it's not clear at all if there's enough to it
that warrants the roguelite metagameplay.

### Improvements and suggestions

* Swap paddles with mouse wheel to be able to play with one hand
* Timed abilities should give an indication of when they're going to disappear
