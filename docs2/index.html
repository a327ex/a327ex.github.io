<p>
  Hi, I’m <b>adn</b>, and I make games. I’m mostly interested in the mix-and-matching aspect of games, 
  like how different items in a roguelite or different nodes in a skill tree come together to create new and interesting gameplay.
</p>

<p>
  I’m also currently focusing my efforts on learning how to make games of some complexity - slightly more complex than 
  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/760330/BYTEPATH/">BYTEPATH</a>, for example - quickly, like every two months or so. 
  This is fairly challenging and it helps keep me focused.
</p>
