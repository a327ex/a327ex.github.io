</ul>

<p>
  Placing text properly turned out to be harder than I thought and I still couldn't get it done properly. 
  Today I tried removing obviously wrong angles, i.e. in this image it would be obviously wrong to place either "challenge" or "rest" texts directly below the node.
</p>

<p>
  While that worked well and I could avoid having any text collide with any edges, it still didn't feel right because I would pick randomly from the remaining possible positions, 
  and it turns out that this is a problem with one correct solution. In the image above the correct solution for the challenge node looks at the angle of the incoming edge and mirrors it, 
  thus placing "challenge" at the top of node.
</p>

<p>
  The rest node, on the other hand, has 3 incoming edges, 2 which cancel each other out vertically, and then another that's sort of angled, 
  so the most aesthetically correct position for the text would be to be on right but slightly above where it is now, mirroring the angle of the left edge.
</p>

<p>
  The bottom node's solution is somewhere to the bottom right, closer to the bottom then to the right. 
  The leftmost node's solution is somewhere to the bottom left, closer to the left than to the bottom. 
  This should be an easy problem to solve but I really struggled with it so far, maybe I just need to rest.
